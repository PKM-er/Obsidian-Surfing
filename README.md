## Introduction

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that allows you to browse the web within Obsidian using v1.0 tabs.

The core functionality of the plugin, rendering a web view, is greatly influenced
by [Ellpeck's Obsidian Custom Frames](https://github.com/Ellpeck/ObsidianCustomFrames) plugin and this plugin wouldn't
have be possible without it.

## TODO

- [ ] Support extensions
- [ ] Support custom CSS
- [ ] Support custom JS

## Feature

- Core Feature
	- Browse arbitrary web pages: The plugin hijacks Obsidian's file, http, https protocols, enabling links to be opened
	  directly in Obsidian, rather than in external browsers. Yes, local HTML and other resources are also supported.
	- Editor web search: You can select keywords in the editor and then right-click to open them in web-browser and
	  search using the default search engine.
	- In-page web search: Again, you can right-click within a web page to use the default search engine search.
	- Copy links pointing to highlights: As with the browser, you can select text and copy the links pointing to it.
	- Use BookmarkLets in your browser to open the URL directly in Obsidian.
	- Copy video timestamp (experimental feature: currently only bilibili is supported): right click on the text to pop
	  up the menu to copy the timestamp, currently there are some bugs, it is known that sometimes the menu does not pop
	  up.
- Auxiliary Feature
	- Open current URL with external browser: right-click menu
	- Default search engine: setting item
	- Default copy highlighted template: setting item (currently only supports very simple templates), please avoid
	  using some special characters
	- Support browsing history: Jump back and forth to the page
	- Clear browsing history: command panel
	- All links are opened in the same panel on the right: Settings
	- Toggle whether to open in the same panel on the right: command panel
	- Simple dark mode: just simple

## Usage

### Use BookmarkLets Open URL

The plugin registers an Obsidain uri protocol that allows you to open eb-broswer in Obsidian using the
URL `obsidian://web-open?url=<url>`. Where `<url>` refers to the web address link.
Match [bookmarklets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) will be able to click a bookmark in the browser to open
the current browser URL within Obsidain.

1. Open the `Open URL In Obsidian Web` option in the plugin settings.
2. Under this option there is a link of bookmarklets, drag this link into your browser's bookmark bar. You can also
   click this link(will copy bookmarklets code), then create bookmarklets by yourself.
3. Now you can click on the bookmark to open the current page of your browser in Obsidian.

### Use Quickadd to search selection in ChatGPT in Surfing

1. Create a macro based on this
   script: [search-in-surfing](https://gist.github.com/Quorafind/c70c6c698feeed66465d59efc39e4e1c)
2. Open ChatGPT in surfing, and select some text, then run the macro.
