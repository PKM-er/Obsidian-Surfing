# Obsidian Web Browser
An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that allows you to browse the web within Obsidian using v1.0 tabs.

The core functionality of the plugin, rendering a web view, is greatly influenced by [Ellpeck's Obsidian Custom Frames](https://github.com/Ellpeck/ObsidianCustomFrames) plugin and this plugin wouldn't have be possible without it.
